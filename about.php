        <p>Hey guys and gals!
            I’m a Computer & Network security student, but am also studying to (hopefully) be part of a Coding school
            right here in the little state of Delaware! Our very first coding school has me revved up for coding. I
            always wanted to learn, especially as I learned more about cyber security I learned that coding is essential
            not only for understanding issues, but in creating solutions. In addition to this though, our area is
            booming for software developers - and the more I learn coding, the more I realize just how much I love it.
            I’m an older student, as I have actually been in customer service for years and have also been a published
            author - but thanks to school and getting some great advice from my college advisor, my career went down a
            different path that utilized my skills more accurately. I have one degree already and am working on my
            second one. I hope to be able to give advice on here one day to others as I learn and go along myself
            (especially while the lessons are still fresh in my mind). Thank you to all the teachers, contributors, and
            other classmates who help us newbs get through these lessons together! Take care!
